## Project Overview

**PDFBOT** uses a combination of LangChain and large language models to convert uploaded PDF documents into an interactive chat assistant. The app provides a conversational interface where users can ask questions about the PDF content and receive relevant responses. 

## Features

- **Upload PDFs**: Drag and drop one or multiple PDF files.
- **Vectorization**: Processes the PDF content into vector embeddings using HuggingFace.
- **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions directly related to PDF content.
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Uses ChromaDB to store and retrieve vectorized document chunks for efficient querying.

## Installation

To set up PDFBOT on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amMistic/PDFBOT.git
   cd PDFBOT
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   groq_api_key=<your_api_key>
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_api_token>
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use PDFBOT.

## Usage

1. **Upload PDF(s)**: In the sidebar, upload your PDFs.
2. **Process PDFs**: Click the "Process" button to convert the content into vector embeddings.
3. **Chat**: Use the input box to ask questions about the uploaded PDF content.

```

## Environment Variables

This project requires a `.env` file with the following variable:
Example:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing LLMs.

## Technical Details

1. **PDF Content Extraction**: Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
2. **Vectorization**: Uses `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` with `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` to create embedding vectors for PDF content.
3. **Database Management**: Vectorized content is stored in a local `ChromaDB` instance for fast retrieval.
4. **LLM Integration**: Uses `ChatGroq` with `Llama3-8b-8192` model for generating responses.
